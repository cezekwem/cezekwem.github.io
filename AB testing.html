        <h2>PROJECT OUTLINE</h2>
        <p>This project outlines the needs of a hypothetical business, “Alpha Beauty" and their A/B Test to figure out how best to serve their customers. The vizualization I create show the test results and enables the business to make an informed decision
        
        <h3>PROJECT BRIEF</h3>
        <p> The company need help driving incremental sales. Specifically, they want to invest in marketing channels  that can prove that for each dollar Alpha Beauty invests, they receive the most incremental sales in return (sales that they would not have received had they not invested).</p>

        <h3>MARKET TEST PLAN</h3>
        <p>The goal of the test is to prove that customers in the exposed groups spend more at Alpha Beauty, compared to customers in the control groups. Specifically, customers were divided into 3 cohorts, each with an exposed and control group (see below).</p>
        </p>Cohort #1: Beta Loyalists These are customers that make >80% of their beauty purchases at Beta Beauty, Alpha’s Beauty’s competitor.</p>
        </p>Cohort #2: Beauty Independents These are customers who spend similar amounts at both Alpha and Beta but are not highly loyal to either brand. Meaning, they spend at both Alpha and Beta but don’t spend +80% of their total spend at either.</p>
        </p> Cohort #3: Alpha Loyalists These are customers that make >80% of their beauty purchases at Alpha Beauty.</p>
       
        <h3>DASHBOARD</h3>
        <p>For this project, although completely fictional, this project is similar from an actual analysis that I've done.
