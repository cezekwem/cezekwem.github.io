        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>

        <p>The project was created to provide the executive team a snapshot of the company performance within a specific time period (in this case, their busiest season- summer) and uncover trends from a  
        complex Google Big Query dataset that consists of almost 82 million rows of data. </p>The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of London Bikes 
        Company and analyze the effects had, if any, during and after COVID 19 for the busiest season, June to September. Executives at this company are interested in reviewing the company's 
        performance to see if/how COVID19 affected the company for the five most popular trip origin stations/locations.</p>

        <p> A comprehensive, interactive dashboard to efficiently convey the required information.</p>

        <p>For this project, data was collected from the Big Query Public Datasets, which stores information about the bike brands, start and end station names, trip duration, etc. (see database scheme below)  </p>
